# SOCIAL FEED - GO - Fiber v2 - Gorm / Postgre 16.4

This repository contains a basic example of a RESTful API service built with **Laravel 12**, intended for research purposes and as a demonstration of my developer profile. It implements the core features of a minimal, custom social feed application and serves as a reference project for learning, experimentation, or as a back-end development code sample.

> ⚠️ **Project Status: In Development**
>
> This repository is currently under active development and not yet ready for use. Features and APIs may change, and breaking changes can occur. Please, be aware that the codebase is actively evolving.

## Project Overview

The API supports a registry of platform "members," enabling users to create posts and voting with like or dislike other users' posts. An administrator role is provided for managing users, content, and platform statistics via a dedicated back office.
